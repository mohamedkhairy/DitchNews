* Task Descriptions 

first this app it's not going to be simple as you ask 

because I create this app from a few months ago 

to submit it in udacity android nanodegree as a final project 

here a documentation of it: https://github.com/mohamedkhairy/DitchNews/blob/master/Capstone_Stage1.pdf

so to pithiness the time I update on this app to cover the required task

-there are some additional feature that you don't need it
-I do a TODO list in the code to focus on the requirements 

-some libraries that I use :
 recyclerView
 retrofit
 firebase
 butterKnife
 mockito & powermock for testing

here's the app apk : https://github.com/mohamedkhairy/DitchNews/raw/master/app/release/app-release.apk

-I used Firebase DB previously so I kept it 
in the NavigationView there are "saved news" button that will display a favorite news

-in the test, I made a simple test to check the news date 

ps: I send you back to ask about what "grouped by day"  and "page param" means ?
and I didn't receive any reply  so here we are
